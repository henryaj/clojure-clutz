# Fizzbuzz in Clojure

Functional programming's renaissance is entering full swing, with languages like Haskell, Erlang and Scala becoming more and more popular.

We spent a day at Makers Academy working with Clojure and exploring the differences between object-oriented and functional programming, as part of our "learn *n* languages in *n* days" week that also saw us working with metaprogramming in Ruby and learning Io.

Here, I implement FizzBuzz in Clojure.

## Testing

Download the repo. From the root directory, execute 

`$ lein test`
